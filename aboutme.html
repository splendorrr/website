    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Doris, and I am a data analyst with a passion for using data to uncover insights and make informed decisions. I specialize in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization. I have experience working with tools such as SQL, Python, STATA, and Excel to analyze datasets and create meaningful reports.</p>

    <p>My goal is to leverage my analytical skills to help organizations make data-driven decisions and improve their business outcomes. I enjoy solving complex problems and turning raw data into actionable insights.</p>

    <p>When I'm not analyzing data, you can find me exploring new technologies, creating art and working with graphic design. I believe in continuous learning and am always looking for new ways to improve my skills and knowledge.
	Also, my focus is to combine tennis and art. I have been in tennis for more than 20 years, and for me it's such a special sport, it can be elegant but also funny. Exclusive and posh but also open to everyone. I love that anyone can play it, regardless of age. 
		In my free time, you will find me on the tennis courts or on the slopes. </p>
