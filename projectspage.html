                <h3>	SQL: Bike Retail Store</h3>
                <p>For this project, we used SQL to see the overall performance of a fictional bicycle store and its products. After data cleaning and mining, we were able to to see patterns which helped us create tables and visualizations representing areas of production, consumers, and sales.

Working on this project strengthened my skills in: writing SQL scripts, connecting tables and creating relationships, and visualizations. The link to this project can be found below.</p>

                  <p>I worked on this project post Covid-19 pandemic, and was inspired to work on this topic, because of what was happening around us. I wanted to learn more about mental health, causes and factors.</p>
                  <p>Mental health is a significant concern in the United States, affecting nearly 500 million adults. Various factors, including genetics, traumatic events, physical health, and societal issues, contribute to mental health challenges.</p>
                  <p>Linear Probability Models indicated that the overall impact of region on mental health was not statistically significant. However, Logit Models revealed significant differences between regions. North Central/Midwest and South regions showed a negative impact on mental health compared to the Northeast, with varying significance levels. The models also explored differences based on marital status, suggesting that location has a more significant impact on the mental health of single individuals compared to married individuals.</p>
                  <p>The study concludes that there is a significant relationship between region and mental health in the United States. Future research should incorporate additional control variables such as weather and migration patterns to further understand the complexities of this relationship. The study provides valuable insights for policymakers and individuals seeking ways to improve mental well-being, suggesting that regional relocation could be a viable option.</p>
